# SimpleWebServer
A Simple Python Webserver

This is a very basic HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket (WS) and Secure Websocket (WSS) Server.
It is intended to be educational and definitely isn't secure. - Don't use it in any production environments unless you understand the risks.



Usage:
- The main file is 'SimpleWebServer3.py'
- This can be executed directly with one command line argument pointing to the config file
- Alternatively, the file can be imported and the class initialised with a dictionary of configuration values.


ToDo:
- Websocket Handshake works, packet parsing needs to be completed
